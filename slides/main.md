## Experimenting with Deno  
## for easier k8s deployments  (?!)

---

## About me

---

### Agenda?


---

### Kubernetes Resource Model

---

### Declarative, awesome

---

### Let's start with running something simple with k8s

- Pod

---

### Now let's add more stuff

- Deployment
- Service
- ConfigMap
- Ingress
- Secrets
- PVCs
- PDBs

---

### I wish it was more simple

---

### Looking at the freighting list

---

### Quick glance - Helm

---

### Pros & Cons - Helm

----

### Quick glance - Kustomize

---

### What's wrong with configuration languages?

---

### What's important?

- Composition
  - Code-Reuse
  - Abstraction
  - Parametrization
- Correctness
  - Type-Safety
  - Testability
- Code Sharing
  - Package management
- Support iterations 
- Developer friendly
  - Programming Language
  - IDE support
  - Boilerplate
  - Ease of use
- Security
  - Runtime
  - Sandbox 

---

### Let's take a look of Deno

---

### CLI

---

### Typescript

---

### Let's create a k8s deployment

---

### Let's create high level abstraction

---

### Let's create a test

---

### Importing external package

---

### And it secure

- Importing malicious package

### Ingredients

- Type generation
- Code re-use building-blocks
- That's all

---

### Great success

---

### Closing notes

--- 

### Deno for 

- There are benefits of using a real programming language, for configuration
- Especially 

### It's done before

- Pulumi
- Amazon CDK
- JKCfg

---

### Deno specific benefits

- No dependencies
- No boilerplate
- Strong security
- Easiest code-reuse

---

### Deploykit OSS

---

### There's also configuration languages of the future

- Dhall
- CUE

Thanks!
